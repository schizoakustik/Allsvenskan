    ''' A full season of Rounds. 

            Attributes:
            -----------
                id : int 
                    The id for the season. The same as the season id at everysport.com for scraping reasons.
                year : str 
                    The year of the season. The type is string because of the seasons that were played over two calendar years.
                rounds : list 
                    A relationship that collects all rounds associated with the season.

            Methods:
            --------
                get_round(n: int):
                    Returns the round with number *n*. Raises IndexError if no such round exists.

                get_final_round():
                    Returns the round currently marked as the final round. Is the season is finished, it is the last round. If the season is in play, it is the latest season with at least one standing.

                as_df():
                    Returns the season as a Pandas DataFrame.

                table():
                    Prints the season's current standings to console.
